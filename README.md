# README #

This abomination of python was created because I used to host steam dedicated servers, took a break, and when I wanted to host one again, I had forgotten how to get everything set up. 

This will take care of installing SteamCMD, installing a dedicated server, and installing sourcemod + metamod (you still have to install plugins)

My Goal with this was to avoid using any third party python libraries in order to
speed up the 0 to play pipeline if you are running this on a fresh linux install

#### Dependencies ####
* Wget and python. Das it baby

### Things I'd like to add ###

* Add more options to the dedicated server list, right now its just a few popular games
* Scrape the metamod/sourcemod webapges for the latest version numbers instead of hardcoding the URLs
* ~~Something to assist with installing steamcmd or maybe even a source dedicated server~~
* Windows support (probably not though)

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
* Other community or team contact
